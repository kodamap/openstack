  # To create the service entity and API endpoint
  # The Identity service manages a catalog of services in your OpenStack environment.
  # Services use this catalog to determine the other services available in your environment.
  #
  # Create the service entity for the Identity service:
  openstack service create \
  --name keystone --description "OpenStack Identity" identity

  # The Identity service manages a catalog of API endpoints associated with the services in your
  # OpenStack environment.
  # Services use this catalog to determine how to communicate with other services in your environment.
  #
  # OpenStack uses three API endpoint variants for each service: admin, internal, and public.
  # The admin API endpoint allows modifying users and tenants by default, while the public and internal
  # APIs do not.
  # In a production environment, the variants might reside on separate networks that service
  # different types of users for security reasons.
  # For instance, the public API network might be reachable from outside the cloud for management tools,
  # the admin API network might be protected, while the internal API network is connected to each host.
  # Also, OpenStack supports multiple regions for scalability.
  # For simplicity, this guide uses the management network for all endpoint variations and the default
  # RegionOne region.
  #
  # Note : Each service that you add to your OpenStack environment requires one or more service entities
  # and one API endpoint in the Identity service.
